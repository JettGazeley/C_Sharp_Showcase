### C Sharp Showcase

The goal of this project is to showcase Object Oriented Programming through a restaurant application.
This project was created with the help of tutorials and online resources.

## Restaurant Class
This class includes three pieces of information: name, address, and gratuity rate of the specified restaurant.
From there, properties with get and set accessors for all the instance variables were created.
Finally, a constructor was defined that initalizes all of the instance variables.

## Generate Receipt
Using a while loop, this method will collect the subtotal for a number of food items and calculate the subtotal of those items.
From there, the method will get the gratuity rate if the members at the table was greater than or equal to 6.
The method then finally displays the amounts for subtotal, gratuity and grand total.

## Restaurant Test
This file was used to test the functions of the restaurant class by generating a sales receipt.
